WHAT IS THIS?
    This is a placeholder for a planned module that will create digital "atoms" that each have their own
    genetically evolved artificial intelligence/genetic rule set for interacting with their virtual 2D world. Each
    atom will occupy only a single space in the virtual world. The goal is to explore whether this framework can be
    used to evolve more complex organisms that are composed of multiple atoms. Draws inspiration from Conway's Game of
    Life, but differs in that, rather than all spaces in the 2D world abiding by the same rule set:
        - each atom will have its own AI/genetic rule set
        - the virtual 2D world will have empty spaces
